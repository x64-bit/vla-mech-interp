## Overview
Chronological transcript capturing technical decisions for the pi05-LIBERO residual capture and SAE probing effort.

### Key Events
1. **Residual Recorder fixes** – ensured instruction tokens capture correctly by storing full hidden states.
2. **Timestamped runs and progress logging** – CLI updates to `save_residuals.py` and documentation.
3. **AdaRMS capture** – added callbacks + writers so decision residuals can be normalized back into logits.
4. **Token decoding sanity check** – demonstrated how to reconstruct logits plus interpreted the noisy outputs.
5. **Full LIBERO-90 capture** – launched background job over layers 6/10/14, batch size 128.

### Conversation Highlights
- Clarified why instruction tokens require full residual slices.
- Explained AdaRMS conditioning and why we need to store it for SAE/logit analysis.
- Discussed SAE training strategy (mid-layer vs final layer) and reconstruction expectations.
- Reviewed token projections and the interpretability implications of noisy logits.
- Set up long-run data capture with progress monitoring and timestamped output.
